# Java-EE-Group-Project

The theme for the Group Project:
1. JPA – for model objects
2. Session beans – for business logic
3. REST – representation of back-end resources
4. JEE security roles – controls who can invoke which operation
5. Testing using JUnit – a series of test cases that demonstrate the operation and correctness of the system
